                    Safety for night shift workers is a growing concern in Melbourne, and with the current trend in
                    crime rates
                    going up, these night shift workers are at a greater risk.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In this age of technology, there is very little data on areas of concern such as crime rate in
                    different
                    locations, police station availability and location by route and emergency alerts if in danger.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Enter, safe@night.cf. The website addresses the above mentioned scenarios, specifically aimed at
                    night shift
                    workers to utilise in making their lives more secure, as outline below.

                    <br/><br/>
                    The specific areas of concern focuses on the crime statistics by area for a users’ preferred route
                    and
                    suggestions for better and more safer route.

                    <br/><br/>
                    Additionally, the website also provides information on the nearest police station based on the
                    users’
                    location as well as police stations on the route taken by the user.

                    <br/><br/>
                    Finally a safety switch functionality is available for users to use in order to send out alerts to
                    the
                    preferred point of contact.

                    <br/><br/>
                    The aim of this website is to deliver these services for night shift workers to use and take a
                    proactive
                    approach in making themselves feel more safe and secure.
